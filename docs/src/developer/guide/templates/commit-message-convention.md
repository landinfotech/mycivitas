# Commit message convention
<!-- To Be Populated -->

## Why Use a Convention?

- **Clarity:** Clearly explain each commit's purpose.
  
- **Searchability:** Easily find specific changes using commit messages.

- **Release Notes:** Simplify the creation of meaningful release notes.

- **Collaboration:** Improve teamwork with a standardised way to document changes.

## Steps to Set Up a Convention

### 1. Choose a Format

```plaintext
<type>(<scope>): <message>
```

## Commit Message Format

- `<type>`: Purpose of the commit (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`).
- `<scope>` (optional): Module/component affected by the commit.
- `<message>`: Clear description of changes made.

## Define Types

Common types include:

- **feat**: New feature or significant change.
- **fix**: Bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation changes.
- **style**: Code style changes.
- **refactor**: Code refactoring.
- **test**: Test-related changes.
- **chore**: Routine tasks or maintenance.

## Message Guidelines

- Use the imperative mood.
- Keep messages concise.

## Examples

### New Feature:

```plaintext
feat(user-auth): add user registration
```

### Bug:

```plaintext
fix(api): resolve status issue
