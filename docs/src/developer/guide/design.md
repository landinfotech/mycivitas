This section describes the visual design approach for the user interface.

## Design sheet

The following documents provide guidance for the standard visual design we use when building the site:
<!-- Add the relevant images into the adjacent img folder using the naming convention -->
<!-- In the name column, add a link to a pdf of the relevant design sheet. e.g. img/design-colours.pdf  -->

| Preview | Name | Notes |
|------------|---------|----------------|
|![Colours](){: style="height:100px;width:75px"} | [Colours]() | Colour Palettes |
|![Buttons](){: style="height:100px;width:75px"} | [Buttons]() | Designs for Buttons. |
|![Form Fields](){: style="height:100px;width:75px"} | [Form Fields]() | Form elements such as input boxes, select lists, radio buttons etc. |
