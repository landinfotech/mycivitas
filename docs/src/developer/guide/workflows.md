## Adding a feature

1. **Creating a GitHub Issue.**

    Creating a GitHub issue for a new feature is the first step in proposing and discussing enhancements in a project. This developer guide provides a step-by-step process for creating an issue specifically for suggesting new features on GitHub.

    ## Steps to create an issue

    ### 1. Navigate to the repository

    - Open a web browser and go to the GitHub repository where you want to create the issue.

    ### 2. Access the issues section

    - Click on the `Issues` tab in the repository's navigation bar.

    ### 3. Start a new issue

    - Click the `New Issue` button to create a new issue.

    ### 4. Fill in the title and description

    - **Title:** Provide a concise and descriptive title for the issue.
    - **Description:** Clearly explain the details of the feature.

    ### 5. Assignees

    - Optionally, assign the issue to one or more team members responsible for addressing it.

    ### 6. Labels

    - Apply relevant labels to categorise the issue (e.g., bug, enhancement, feature). This helps in organising and prioritising tasks.

    ### 7. Add project

    - Associate the new issue with a project board if applicable.
    - Projects help organise and track the progress of related tasks.

    ### 8. Submit the issue

    - Click the `Submit new issue` button to create the issue.

    ### 9. Interact and follow up

    - Engage in discussions with other contributors and maintainers in the issue's comment section.
    - Provide additional information if requested and stay involved in the resolution process.

    ## Best Practices

    1. **Be Descriptive:** Clearly articulate the feature to help others understand the context.

    2. **Assign Appropriately:** Assign the issue to the relevant team member.

    3. **Label Categorisation:** Apply appropriate labels for better issue categorisation.

    4. **Stay Engaged:** Follow up on the issue and participate in discussions to assist in its resolution.

    ## Conclusion

    Creating a GitHub issue for a new feature is a fundamental aspect of collaborative development. By following this developer guide, you ensure that the feature requests are well-documented and effectively communicated. This process contributes to the overall enhancement and progress of the project, fostering a collaborative environment for developing and implementing exciting new features.

2. **Wait for it to be added to a Sprint.**

    - Allow time for the new feature or issue to be scheduled and included in a sprint or development cycle.

3. **Functional Tests.**

    - Develop and execute functional tests to ensure that the newly added feature or code meets the specified requirements and functions as intended.

4. **Write End User Documentation.**

    - Create comprehensive documentation that provides end users with clear instructions and information on how to use the new feature or functionality.


## Fixing a Bug

1. **Creating a GitHub Issue.**

    Initiating a GitHub issue for a bug is the initial step in identifying, discussing, and resolving issues in a project. This developer guide outlines the step-by-step process of creating a bug-related issue on GitHub.

    ## Steps to create a bug-fix issue

    ### 1. Navigate to the repository

    - Open a web browser and go to the GitHub repository where the bug is identified.

    ### 2. Access the issues section

    - Click on the `Issues` tab in the repository's navigation bar.

    ### 3. Start a new issue

    - Click the `New Issue` button to create a new issue specifically for the bug.

    ### 4. Fill in the Title and Description

    - **Title:** Provide a concise and descriptive title for the bug.
    - **Description:** Clearly explain the details of the bug, including steps to reproduce if possible.

    ### 5. Assignees

    - Optionally, assign the issue to one or more team members responsible for fixing the bug.

    ### 6. Labels

    - Apply relevant labels to categorise the issue (e.g., bug, enhancement, feature). This helps in organising and prioritising tasks.

    ### 7. Add Project

    - Associate the new bug issue with a project board if applicable.
    - Projects help organise and track the progress of related tasks.

    ### 8. Submit the Issue

    - Click the `Submit new issue` button to create the bug-related issue.

    ### 9. Interact and Follow Up

    - Engage in discussions with other contributors and maintainers in the issue's comment section.
    - Provide additional information if requested and stay involved in the resolution process.

    ## Best Practices

    1. **Be Descriptive:** Clearly articulate the bug to help others understand the context.

    2. **Assign Appropriately:** Assign the issue to the relevant team member responsible for fixing the bug.

    3. **Label Categorisation:** Apply appropriate labels for better issue categorisation.

    4. **Stay Engaged:** Follow up on the issue and participate in discussions to assist in its resolution.

    ## Conclusion

    Creating a GitHub issue for fixing a bug is a crucial aspect of collaborative development. This developer guide ensures that bug reports are well-documented and effectively communicated, contributing to the overall stability and progress of the project.

2. **Wait for it to be added to a Sprint:** Once the bug is identified and logged, wait for it to be added to a sprint by the development team. This ensures that the bug is prioritised and scheduled for resolution within the project timeline.

3. **Regression Test:** Before implementing any fix, perform regression testing to ensure that the fix does not introduce new issues or impact existing functionalities adversely. This involves retesting the affected areas as well as related functionalities to verify the stability of the system.

4. **Implement Fix:** Once the bug is assigned to a sprint and regression testing is completed successfully, proceed to implement the fix. Follow the guidelines provided by the development team and make the necessary updates to the documentation to resolve the identified issue effectively.
