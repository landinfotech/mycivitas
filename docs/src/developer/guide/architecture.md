# System architecture

In this section, we outline the system architecture using ER Diagrams, Software Component Diagrams etc. and key libraries / frameworks used in this project.

## Software components used
<!-- These are generic. Customise as needed per project -->

The following is a list, with brief descriptions, of the key components used in creating this platform. Please refer to their individual documentation for in-depth technical information.

| Logo | Name | Notes |
|------------|---------|----------------|
|![](https://static.djangoproject.com/img/logos/django-logo-negative.svg){: style="height:30px;width:30px"} | [Django](https://djangoproject.com) | Django makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code. | 
|![](img/architecture-backbone-js-icon.svg){: style="height:30px;width:30px"}| [Backbone JS](https://backbonejs.org/) | Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.|
| ![](img/architecture-docker.svg){: style="height:30px;width:30px"} | [Docker](https://docker.com) | Accelerate how you build, share, and run applications. Docker helps developers build, share, and run applications anywhere â€” without tedious environment configuration or management. |
| ![](img/architecture-celery.svg){: style="height:30px;width:30px"} | [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev) | Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system. Itâ€™s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling. |
| ![](img/architecture-celery.svg){: style="height:30px;width:30px"} | [Celery Beat](https://github.com/celery/django-celery-beat) | This extension enables you to store the periodic task schedule in your database. The periodic tasks can be managed from the Django Admin interface, where you can create, edit and delete periodic tasks and how often they should run. |
| ![](img/architecture-drf.png){: style="height:30px;width:30px"} | [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) | Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. |
| ![](img/architecture-maplibre-logo.svg){: style="height:30px;width:30px"} | [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/)  | Open-source mapping libraries for web and mobile app developers. |
| ![](img/architecture-postgis.svg){: style="height:30px;width:30px"} | [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) | PostGIS extends the capabilities of the PostgreSQL relational database by adding support storing, indexing and querying geographic data. |
| ![](img/architecture-postgresql.png){: style="height:30px;width:30px"} | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) | PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.  |
