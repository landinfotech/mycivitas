## Introduction

MyCivitas is a revolutionary project aimed at providing small communities with an affordable and user-friendly asset management platform. Our all-inclusive and easy-to-use platform is designed to empower you to record and manage your assets seamlessly within a powerful information system. MyCivitas is committed to simplifying the complex task of asset management, ensuring that even small communities can efficiently organise and oversee their valuable resources. Join us in embracing a solution that combines accessibility, affordability, and functionality for a streamlined approach to community asset management.

## Key concepts

**How does MyCivitas work?:** The heart of MyCivitas is a map of your community and its assets and infrastructure.

**Capture your infrastructure:** Create an asset inventory using powerful mapping software. Our data capture system uses QGIS, a free and open-source desktop application.

**Prioritize Your Assets:** Our system performs risk assessment analysis and preventative maintenance planning analysis on your data.

**Support Your Capital Planning:** Make informed decisions to support your capital planning.

**Set Up Work Order:** Use the platform to plan ad hoc and scheduled maintenance planning tasks.

**We Are Here to Help:** Let us know if you need any help along the way, from capturing data to presenting to the council. We have a team of experienced staff available.

Please note that support is not included in the hosting fee. A popular option for small communities is to sign an annual support contract. Please inquire (support@civitas.ca) and we will connect you with a team member near you

**Enjoy Asset Management:** Practice effective and sustainable asset management on our affordable platform to benefit your community.
