## Introduction

MyCivitas is a revolutionary project aimed at providing small communities with an affordable and user-friendly asset management platform. Our all-inclusive and easy-to-use platform is designed to empower you to record and manage your assets seamlessly within a powerful information system. MyCivitas is committed to simplifying the complex task of asset management, ensuring that even small communities can efficiently organise and oversee their valuable resources. Join us in embracing a solution that combines accessibility, affordability, and functionality for a streamlined approach to community asset management.

## Key concepts

**How does MyCivitas work?:** MyCivitas begins by providing a comprehensive map of your community, highlighting its assets and infrastructure. Users can capture and document essential information about the physical components within the community. With the gathered data, prioritise your community assets based on their significance and needs. MyCivitas allows you to assess and categorise assets for better management and decision-making. MyCivitas aids in capital planning by offering insights into the condition and importance of various community assets. This information supports strategic planning and budget allocation for effective infrastructure development. Streamline maintenance and improvement processes by setting up work orders within MyCivitas. Assign tasks, schedule activities, and track progress to ensure timely and efficient execution of projects. MyCivitas provides a robust platform for ongoing asset management. Monitor the status of infrastructure, track changes, and utilise the system to make informed decisions for the sustainable development of your community.

**Capture your infrastructure:** Create a detailed asset inventory by leveraging powerful mapping software. Our data capture system utilises QGIS, a free and open-source desktop application, making it user-friendly and accessible.

**Prioritize Your Assets:** Our system goes beyond simple inventory; it performs risk assessment analysis and preventative maintenance planning on your data. This ensures a nuanced understanding of asset priorities, allowing you to focus on areas that need immediate attention or mitigation.

**Support Your Capital Planning:** MyCivitas empowers you to make informed decisions crucial for supporting your capital planning. By providing comprehensive insights into asset conditions and requirements, you can strategically allocate resources and budget effectively.

**Set Up Work Order:** Streamline your maintenance processes by utilising the platform to plan both ad hoc and scheduled maintenance tasks. MyCivitas enables efficient task assignment, scheduling, and tracking, facilitating a proactive approach to infrastructure management.

**We Are Here to Help:** Let us know if you need any help along the way, from capturing data to presenting to the council. We have a team of experienced staff available.

Please note that support is not included in the hosting fee. A popular option for small communities is to sign an annual support contract. Please inquire (support@civitas.ca) and we will connect you with a team member near you

**Enjoy Asset Management:** Practice effective and sustainable asset management on our affordable platform to benefit your community.
