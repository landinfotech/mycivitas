Welcome to the MyCivitas administrator guide. In this section of the documentation, we aim to show administrators common workflows for managing the platform effectively. Here is a brief overview of the content provided here:

* **[Accessing the Administration Site:](./access-admin-site.md)** This section contains a quick description of how administrators can access the administration site of the MyCivitas platform.

* **[Managing Users:](./manage-user.md)** This section describes how administrators can manage users ( i.e. their details, their permissions, etc.) on the MyCivitas platform.
